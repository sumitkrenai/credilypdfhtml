        <p>The Provider agrees to participate in the Florida Medicaid program under the following terms and conditions:</p>
        <p>(1) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Discrimination</span>. The parties agree that the Agency for Health Care Administration (agency) may make payments for
            medical assistance and related services rendered to Medicaid recipients only to an individual or entity who has a provider
            agreement in effect with the agency, who is performing services or supplying goods in accordance with federal, state, and
            local law, and who agrees that no person shall, on the grounds of sex, handicap, race, color, or national origin, other
            insurance, or for any other reason, be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity for which the provider
            receives payment from the agency.</p>
        <p>(2) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Quality of Service</span>. The provider agrees that services or goods billed to the Medicaid program must be medically
            necessary, of a quality comparable to those furnished by the provider's peers, and within the parameters permitted by the
            provider’s license or certification. The provider further agrees to bill only for the services performed within the specialty or
            specialties designated in the provider application on file with the agency. The services or goods must have been actually
            provided to eligible Medicaid recipients by the provider prior to submitting the claim.</p>
        <p>(3) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Compliance</span>. The provider agrees to comply fully with all state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and statements of
            policy applicable to the Medicaid program, including the Medicaid Provider Handbooks issued by the agency, as well as
            all federal, state, and local laws pertaining to licensure, if required, and the practice of any of the healing arts.</p>
        <p>(4) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Term and signatures</span>. The parties agree that this is a voluntary agreement between the agency and the provider, in
            which the provider agrees to furnish services or goods to Medicaid recipients. Provided that all requirements for
            enrollment have been met, this agreement shall remain in effect for five (5) years from the effective date of the provider’s
            eligibility for initial enrollment unless otherwise terminated. With respect to reenrolling providers, the agreement shall
            remain in effect for five (5) years from either the date the most recent agreement expires or the date the provider signs the
            renewal agreement, which ever date is earlier, unless otherwise terminated. This agreement shall be renewable only by
            mutual consent. The provider understands and agrees that no agency signature is required to make this agreement valid
            and enforceable.</p>
        <p>(5) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Provider Responsibilities</span>. The Medicaid provider shall:</p>
        <p>(a) Possess at the time of signing of the provider agreement, and maintain in good standing throughout the period of the
            agreement's effectiveness, a valid professional, occupational, facility or other license pertinent to the services or goods
            being provided, as required by the state or locality in which the provider is located, and the Federal Government, if
            applicable.</p>
        <p>(b) Maintain in a systematic and orderly manner all medical and Medicaid-related records the agency requires and
            determines are relevant to the services or goods being provided.</p>
        <p>(c) Retain all medical and Medicaid-related records for a period of five (5) years to satisfy all necessary inquiries by the
            agency</p>
        <p>(d) Safeguard the use and disclosure of information pertaining to current or former Medicaid recipients and comply with
            all state and federal laws pertaining to confidentiality of patient information.</p>
        <p>(e) Send, at the provider’s expense, all Medicaid-related information, which may be in the form of records, logs,
            documents, or computer files, and other information pertaining to services or goods billed to the Medicaid program,
            including access to all patient records and other provider information if the provider cannot easily separate records for
            Medicaid patients from other records to the Attorney General, the Federal Government, and the authorized agents of each
            of these entities.</p>

            <p>(f) Bill other insurers and third parties, including the Medicare program, before billing the Medicaid program, if the
                recipient is eligible for payment for health care or related services from another insurer or person and comply with all other
                state and federal requirements in this regard.</p>
            <p>(g) Report and refund any moneys received in error or in excess of the amount to which the provider is entitled from the
                Medicaid program within 90 days of receipt.</p>
            <p>(h) Be liable for and indemnify, defend, and hold the agency harmless from all claims, suits, judgments, or damages,
                including court costs and attorney's fees, arising out of the negligence or omissions of the provider in the course of
                providing services to a recipient or a person believed to be a recipient to the extent allowed by in and accordance with
                section 768.28, F.S. (2001), and any successor legislation.</p>
            <p>(i) Provide proof of liability insurance at the option of the agency and maintain such insurance in effect for any period
                during which services of goods are furnished to Medicaid recipients.</p>
            <p>(j) Accept Medicaid payment as payment in full, and not bill or collect from the recipient or the recipient's responsible
                party any additional amount except, and only to the extent the agency permits or requires, co-payments, coinsurance, or
                deductibles to be paid by the recipient for the services or goods provided. This includes situations in which the provider’s
                Medicare coinsurance claims are denied in accordance with Medicaid policy.</p>
            <p>(k) Comply with all of the requirements of Section 6032 (Employee Education About False Claims Recovery) of the Deficit
                Reduction Act of 2005, if the provider receives or earns five million dollars or greater annually under the State plan.</p>
            <p>(l) Submit, within 35 days of the date on a request by the Secretary or the Medicaid agency, full and complete information
                about the ownership of any subcontractor with whom the provider has had business transactions totaling more than
                $25,000 during the 12-month period ending on the date of the request; and any significant business transactions between
                the provider and any wholly owned supplier, or between the provider and any subcontractor, during the 5-year period
                ending on the date of the request.</p>
            <p>(m) Employ only individuals who may legally work in the United States, either U.S. citizens or foreign citizens who are
                authorized to work in the U.S, in compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 which prohibits
                employers from knowingly hiring illegal workers.</p>
            <p>(n) Utilize the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify Employment Eligibility Verification system to verify the
                employment eligibility of all persons employed by the provider during the term of this Contract to perform employment
                duties within Florida and all persons (including subcontractors) assigned by the provider to perform work pursuant to this
                Contract. The provider shall include this provision in all subcontracts it enters into for the performance of work under this
                Contract.</p>
            <p>(o) Attest that all statements and information furnished by the prospective provider before signing the provider agreement
                shall be true and complete. The filing of a materially incomplete, misleading or false application will make the application
                and agreement voidable at the option of the agency and is sufficient cause for immediate termination of the provider from
                the Medicaid program and/or revocation of the provider number..</p>
            <p>(p) Agree to notify the agency of any changes to the information furnished on the Florida Medicaid Provider Enrollment
                Application, including but not limited to changes of address, tax identification number, group affiliation, or depository bank
                account. The provider shall report a change in any principal of the provider, including any officer, director, agent,
                managing employee, or affiliated person, or any partner or shareholder who has an ownership interest equal to five (5)
                percent or more in the provider to the agency in writing within thirty (30) days after the change occurs. For a hospital
                licensed under chapter 395, F.S., or a nursing home licensed under part II of chapter 400, F.S., a principal of the provider
                is one who meets the definition of a controlling interest under s. 408.803, F.S.</p>
            <p>(q) Agree to notify the agency within 5 business days after suspension or disenrollment from Medicare. Failure to notify
                may result in sanctions imposed pursuant s. 409.908 (24) and the provider may be required to return funds paid to the
                provider during the period of time that the provider was suspended or disenrolled as a Medicare provider.</p>
            <p>(r) Search the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), located at <a href="http://www.oig.hhs.gov/fraud/exclusions.asp">http://www.oig.hhs.gov/fraud/exclusions.asp</a>, and
                the Agency’s final order database, located at <a href="http://apps.ahca.myflorida.com/dm_web">http://apps.ahca.myflorida.com/dm_web</a>, monthly to determine whether any
                employee or contractor has been excluded. Providers will notify the Agency immediately any exclusion information
                discovered. Civil monetary penalties may be imposed against Medicaid providers and managed care entities who employ
                or enter into contracts with excluded individuals or entities to provide items or services to Medicaid recipients.</p>

        <p>(6) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Agency Responsibilities</span>. The agency shall:</p>
        <p>(a) Make timely payment at the established rate for services or goods furnished to a recipient by the provider upon receipt
            of a properly completed claim.</p>
        <p>(b) Not seek repayment from the provider in any instance in which the Medicaid overpayment is attributable to error of the
            agency in the determination of eligibility of a recipient.</p>
        <p>(7) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Change of Ownership</span>. A Medicaid provider agreement may be revoked, at the option of the agency, as the result of a
            change of ownership of any facility, association, partnership, or other entity named as the provider in the provider
            agreement.</p>
        <p>(a) If the provider sells or transfers a business interest or practice that substantially constitutes the entity named as the
            provider in the provider agreement, or sells or transfers a facility that is of substantial importance to the entity named as
            the provider in the provider agreement, the provider is required to maintain and make available to the agency Medicaidrelated records that relate to the sale or transfer of the business interest, practice, or facility in the same manner as
            though the sale or transaction had not taken place, unless the provider enters into an agreement with the purchaser of the
            business interest, practice, or facility to fulfill this requirement.</p>
        <p>(b) If there is a change of ownership, the transferor remains liable for all outstanding overpayments, administrative fines,
            and any other moneys owed to the agency before the effective date of the change. The transferee is also liable to the
            agency for all outstanding overpayments identified by the agency on or before the effective date of the change of
            ownership. In the event of a change of ownership for a skilled nursing facility or intermediate care facility, the Medicaid
            provider agreement shall be assigned to the transferee if the transferee meets all other Medicaid provider qualifications.
            In the event of a change of ownership involving a skilled nursing facility licensed under part II of chapter 400, liability for all
            outstanding overpayments, administrative fines, and any moneys owed to the agency before the effective date of the
            change of ownership shall be determined in accordance with s. <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">400.179</span>, F.S.</p>
        <p>(c) At least 60 days before the anticipated date of the change of ownership, the transferor shall notify the agency of the
            intended change of ownership and the transferee shall submit to the agency a Medicaid provider enrollment application. If
            a change of ownership occurs without compliance with the notice requirements of this subsection, the transferor and
            transferee shall be jointly and severally liable for all overpayments, administrative fines, and other moneys due to the
            agency, regardless of whether the agency identified the overpayments, administrative fines, or other moneys before or
            after the effective date of the change of ownership. The agency may not approve a transferee’s Medicaid provider
            enrollment application if the transferee or transferor has not paid or agreed in writing to a payment plan for all outstanding
            overpayments, administrative fines, and other moneys due to the agency. This subsection does not preclude the agency
            from seeking any other legal or equitable remedies available to the agency for the recovery of moneys owed to the
            Medicaid program. In the event of a change of ownership involving a skilled nursing facility licensed under part II of
            chapter 400, liability for all outstanding overpayments, administrative fines, and any moneys owed to the agency before
            the effective date of the change of ownership shall be determined in accordance with s. <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">400.179</span> if the Medicaid provider
            enrollment application for change of ownership is submitted before the change of ownership.</p>
        <p>(d)  As used in this subsection, the term:</p>
        <p>(1.) "Administrative fines" includes any amount identified in a notice of a monetary penalty or fine which has been issued
            by the agency or other regulatory or licensing agency that governs the provider.</p>
        <p>(2.) "Outstanding overpayment" includes any amount identified in a preliminary audit report issued to the transferor by the
            agency on or before the effective date of a change of ownership.</p>
        <p>(8) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Termination for Convenience</span>. This agreement may be terminated without cause upon thirty (30) days written notice
            by either party.</p>
        <p>(9) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Interpretation</span>. When interpreting this agreement, it shall be neither construed against either party nor considered
            which party prepared the agreement.</p>
        <p>(10) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Governing Law</span>. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
            Florida. Both parties concur that this agreement is a legal and binding document and is fully enforceable in a court of
            competent jurisdiction. Any legal action involving this agreement will be brought in the appropriate court in Leon County,
            Florida, and the parties submit to exclusive venue and personal jurisdiction in that court.</p>

        <p>(11) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Amendment</span>. This agreement, application and supporting documents constitute the full and entire agreement and
            understanding between the parties with respect to their relationship. No amendment is effective unless it is in writing and
            signed by each party.</p>
        <p>(12) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Severability</span>. If one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement or application shall be invalid, illegal or
            unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
            impaired.</p>
        <p>(13) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Agreement Retention.</span>. The parties agree that the agency may only retain the signature page of this agreement, and
            that a copy of this standard provider agreement will be maintained by the Director of Medicaid, or his designee, and may
            be reproduced as a duplicate original for any legal purpose and may also be entered into evidence as a business record.</p>
        <p>(14) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Funding.</span> This contract is contingent upon the availability of funds.</p>
        <p>(15) <span style="border-bottom: 2px solid #000;display: inline-block;line-height: 1;">Assignability.</span> The parties agree that neither may assign their rights under this agreement without the express written
        <p>The provider, or each principal of the provider if the provider is a corporation, partnership, association, or other entity, is
            required to sign this agreement. For this purpose, principals includes partners or shareholders of five (5) percent or more,
            officers, directors, managers, financial records custodian, medical records custodian, subcontractors, and individuals
            holding signing privileges on the depository account, and other affiliated person. A chief executive officer (CEO) or
            president may sign this agreement in lieu of all principals. Failure to sign the agreement will make the agreement and
            provider number voidable by the agency.</p>
        <p>The signatories hereto represent and warrant that they have read the agreement, understand it, and are authorized to
            execute it on behalf of their respective principals or co-owners. This agreement becomes null and void upon transfer of
            assets; change of ownership; or upon discovery by the agency of the submission of a materially incomplete, misleading or
            false provider application unless subsequently ratified or approved by the agency.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Arial-bold';">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this agreement to be duly executed under the penalties of
            perjury, and now affirms that the foregoing is true and correct.</p>
